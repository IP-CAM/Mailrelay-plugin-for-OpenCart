------ Installing MailRelay plugin for OpenCart -------
--------------------------------------------------------

The installation of the MailRelay plugin product for OpenCart is very simple. It only takes a few steps to do it.

After installing the extension we will go to option "Extensions -> Modules -> Mailrelay Sync -> Edit" this option will let you sync all your OpenCart users with your Mailrelay account.
This will save you time when syncing and organizing your users in groups.

Let's start with the installation process:

-------------------
First required step
-------------------

The first step, in order for us to be able to use the extension, is to enable the API key of our Mailrelay account. For that we need to log in our Mailrelay account
admin panel. Once we are there we will go to the "Settings" menu, then "API access". On that screen click on the "Generate new API key" button.
It's not necessary for us to write down this key, once it's generated, the extension will be able to get it using your user and password data.

----------------------------------------
Upload the necessary files to the server
----------------------------------------

The Mailrelay plugins comes into a .zip file. The content of it must be extracted inside the folder where OpenCart is installed.

---------------------------------------
Installation from OpenCart admin panel
---------------------------------------

Once we have uploaded all the required files, we need to do some configs from the admin panel:

- We will go to the "Extensions -> Modules -> Mailrelay Sync -> Edit" option
- If it shows it's deactivated, we click on Activate to enable it

This finishes the installation process.

-------------------------
Configuring the extension
-------------------------

Once the extension is installed we will have a new settings option. We will go to Settings > Mailrelay option.
Clicking on this option will take us to a form where we need to fill the following data:

- Host (this can be found in your Mailrelay welcome email). Please note that the host must be entered without initial http://
- API key (the API key generated for our Mailrelay account)

Once this data is successfully saved we can start the user sync.

----------
Sync users
----------

After the configuration, we will click on "Save" button. If settings are correct we can select the groups of our
Mailrelay account that must be sync with the OpenCart users. We will select one of them and will press the "Start Sync" button.

We will see the following screen, that simply shows us the sync process. It shows the total users synced.

[ NOTE: Depending on the number of users to sync, the process can take from some seconds to several minutes. ]

---------
Uninstall
---------

Uninstalling the extension is as easy as installing it. You only have to go to "Extensions -> Modules -> Mailrelay Sync -> Uninstall".
Selecting this option, the extension will be disabled.
The files won't be removed from ftp, to do that you must remove the right folders and files.
